# Crossword Puzzle Game in C++

Welcome to the Crossword Puzzle Game in C++ repository! This console-based game allows you to play a simple crossword puzzle by guessing words related to a specific theme.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nusRying/CrossWord-Puzzle-Using-C-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd CrossWord-Puzzle-Using-C-
   ```

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o crossword
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./crossword
   ```

## How to Play

1. Upon running the game, you'll be prompted to enter your name.

2. The game will generate a crossword puzzle grid containing a hidden word related to the theme.

3. Depending on the length of the word, a portion of the crossword puzzle will be shown with missing letters.

4. Enter your guess for the missing word. If your guess matches the hidden word, you'll win a point. Otherwise, you'll lose.

5. After completing a round, you can choose to play again or exit the game.

6. The game will display your final score when you decide to exit.
